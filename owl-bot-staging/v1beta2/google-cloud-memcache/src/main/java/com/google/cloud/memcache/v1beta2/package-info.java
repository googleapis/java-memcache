 * <p>======================= CloudMemcacheClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Configures and manages Cloud Memorystore for Memcached instances.
 *
 * <p>The `memcache.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore for Memcached
 * API and defines the following resource model for managing Memorystore Memcached (also called
 * Memcached below) instances:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/&#42;`
 *   <li> Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/&#42;`
 *   <li> Each location has a collection of Memcached instances, named: `/instances/&#42;`
 *   <li> As such, Memcached instances are resources of the form:
 *       `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that location_id must be a GCP `region`; for example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> `projects/my-memcached-project/locations/us-central1/instances/my-memcached`
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Sample for CloudMemcacheClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (CloudMemcacheClient cloudMemcacheClient = CloudMemcacheClient.create()) {
 *   InstanceName name = InstanceName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[INSTANCE]");
 *   Instance response = cloudMemcacheClient.getInstance(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
